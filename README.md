## Loan Prediction Project
```
Welcome to the exciting loan detection project! In this project, we will explore the world of loan detection using machine learning. What makes this project so interesting? We have carefully selected the algorithm, and the result is the use of the decision tree classifier algorithm which has been proven to provide the highest accuracy compared to various other algorithms. To ensure the reliability of the results, we applied sophisticated cross-validation techniques. We will explore lending data, discover hidden patterns, and make accurate predictions to help applicants
